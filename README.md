# AZ Desert Designer

## About This Project
AZ Desert Designer is a design site I created to showcase my ability to design and develop a website for a design company.

I have a love for photography and I wanted to create a site where I could showcase my photography and also showcase my creative side to create and design ideas.  

It will continually be a work in progress as my creativity evolves and changes as time passes. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript...for now

## Installation/Usage
This is a live site that I am hosting with Hostinger and can be accessed here: https://www.azdesertdesigner.com
